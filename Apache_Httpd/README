Before start compiling, read the following points :

1)With the latest version of the compiling script, should not be necessary the manual download of the httpd source archive, anyway i put the link for any reasons :) :

download latest httpd  2.4.x  source archive in gz format from :
http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#apache24

2)download latest tomcat connectors source archive in gz format from :

http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/
